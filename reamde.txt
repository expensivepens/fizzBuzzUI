things I learned :
-a bit about animations in css
-took some code from somewhere else for the first time
-made me work a bit on typography and styling a paragraph
-made me think about design in general
-made me learn about timers in JS with the setInterval function,
it made me learn a bit about asynchronous JS (look up the course about that that I read before) because of the loop problem
-it made try to use ChatGPT in a useful way without cheating
-thought about optimizing the fizzbuzz algo and went back to eloquent JS => write down what it made me learn exactly.
