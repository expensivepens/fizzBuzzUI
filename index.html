                    <span class="fizz">Fizz</span> <span class="buzz">buzz</span> is a group word game for children to teach them about division. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "<span class="description-fizz">fizz</span>", and any number divisible by five with the word "<span class="buzz">buzz</span>", and any number divisible by both 3 and 5 with the word "<span class="fizz">fizz</span><span class="buzz">buzz</span>".

Writing a program to output the first 100 <span class="fizz">Fizz</span><span class="buzz">Buzz</span> numbers is a relatively trivial problem requiring little more than a loop and conditional statements. However, its value in coding interviews is to analyze fundamental coding habits that may be indicative of overall coding ingenuity.
